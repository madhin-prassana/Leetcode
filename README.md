# Leetcode

Day 1 -> 13. Roman to Integer
This is my first Leetcode question and I am confused why it throws a compilation error--it ran fine on CLion. I guess I have to run the code using the preset code snippet I deleted i.e., using the 'Solution' class but... why? Why can't I have some freedom in solving a question? Why do I have to do it exactly like you want me to? Of course, I could try to fix it and make it mesh with the hidden code (I don't even have a Line 47) but I'm not going to do that because the CODE IS CORRECT.

Day 2 -> 125. Valid Palindrome
This time I solved the code by building on the preset snippet (using a Solution class and then calling it in Main) so I faced no issues at all.
