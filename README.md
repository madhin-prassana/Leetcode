# Leetcode

Day 1 -> 13. Roman to Integer
This is my first Leetcode question and I am confused why it throws a compilation error--it ran fine on CLion. I guess I have to run the code using the preset code snippet I deleted i.e., using the 'Solution' class but... why? Why can't I have some freedom in solving a question? Why do I have to do it exactly like you want me to? Of course, I could try to fix it and make it mesh with the hidden code (I don't even have a Line 47) but I'm not going to do that because the CODE IS CORRECT.

Day 2 -> 125. Valid Palindrome
This time I solved the code by building on the preset snippet (using a Solution class and then calling it in Main) so I faced no issues at all.

Day 3 -> 1. Two Sum
[ Time taken: 8 m 44 s ] This is the first time I'm solving the question in LeetCode itself and not on Clion, hence the timer.

Day 4 -> 3. Longest Substring without repeating characters
[ Time taken: 7 m 21 s ] Implementing Sliding Window Protocol with a Hash set.

Day 4 -> 2873. Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet I
[ Time taken: 11 m 30 s ] Might not be the most elegant and is definitely not the most time efficient but brute force gets the job done.

Day 5 -> 9. Palindrome Number
[ Time taken: 6 m 50 s ] I cannot believe it took me this long to find a goddamn Palindrome. Made a logic error that gave me incorrect output and it took me longer than it should have to figure that out.

Day 7 -> 67. Add Binary
[ Time taken: 8 m 58 s ] Yeah, this is not easy. I don't know how they have marked it as one. Spent a lot longer than 9 minutes working on the loop and kept getting incorrect answers and almost though about switching to a different question (which was why I paused) but finally.

Day 8 -> 217. Contains Duplicate
[ Time taken: 8 m 47 s ] 

Day 9. -> 136. Single Number
[ Time taken: 7 m 29 s ] Runtime beats 5.02 % :( but if it works it works.

Day 10. -> (Order)66. Plus One
[ Time taken: 11 m 18 s ]
